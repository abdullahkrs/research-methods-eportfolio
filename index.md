## Module Overview

This module provides a practical foundation in research methods for computing projects, including:

- Planning and designing a research study  
- Collecting and analysing data  
- Understanding legal, ethical, social and professional responsibilities  
- Communicating research clearly in written and oral form  

Throughout the module I maintain this e-Portfolio to demonstrate:

- My engagement with **formative activities**  
- My completion of **e-Portfolio (assessed) activities**  
- My reflection on how these activities developed my skills as a researcher

## Final Reflection

In this final section I summarise how the module has:

- Developed my understanding of research methods in computing  
- Improved my practical skills (literature searching, critical evaluation, statistics, proposal writing)  
- Influenced my plans for my MSc Project and future professional practice  

I also comment on:

- Which activities were most impactful and why  
- How feedback from the tutor and peers shaped my work  
- Specific next steps I plan to take as a researcher and AI practitioner
