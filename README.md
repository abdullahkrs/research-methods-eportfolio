# Research Methods and Professional Practice – e-Portfolio  
**Module:** Research Methods and Professional Practice October 2025 A  
**Programme:** MSc Artificial Intelligence – University of Essex Online  
**Student:** Abdullah Khalfan Rashid Abdullah

This repository contains my e-Portfolio for the *Research Methods and Professional Practice* module.  
It brings together all required activities (collaborative discussions, reflective tasks, worksheets and quizzes) and maps them clearly to the module units.

🔗 **Live e-Portfolio Website (GitHub Pages)**  
Once GitHub Pages is enabled, the site will be available at:  
`https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/rmpp-eportfolio-2025a/`

## Structure

- `index.md` – main e-Portfolio website (landing page and navigation)
- `assets/` – any images or diagrams used in the portfolio
- `artefacts/` – PDFs, Word documents or screenshots of submitted work
- `reflections/` – longer reflections (if stored as separate markdown files)

## How to Navigate

The website is structured by:

- **Overview** – module description and my learning goals  
- **Module Activity Map** – table that links each unit to its formative / e-Portfolio activities  
- **Unit Pages (1–12)** – evidence and reflection for each activity  
- **Final Reflection** – overall reflection on my development during the module

The aim is to make it easy for the tutor to:

1. See which activity is linked to which unit.  
2. Open the artefact quickly (discussion posts, worksheets, quizzes, etc.).  
3. Read my short reflection on what I learned from each activity.
