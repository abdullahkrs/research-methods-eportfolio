            <h3>Overview of the Peer Review Activity</h3>
          </div>
          <p class="cd-lead">
            In Seminar 2, I participated in a structured peer review activity focused on evaluating
            research design and methodology. Each student prepared a short outline describing their
            research topic, research question(s), proposed methods, and data sources. We then reviewed
            a peer’s outline using the concepts from Units 1–3, including research purpose, design,
            and the differences between qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods.
          </p>
          <p>
            My contribution involved (1) presenting my own outline, centred on the use of Artificial
            Intelligence in a computing context, and (2) critically evaluating a peer’s outline in
            terms of clarity of the research question, appropriateness of the chosen methodology, and
            alignment between data collection, analysis and research aims. The activity helped me
            connect the theoretical content from the seminars with real, practical examples of research
            planning.
          </p>
          <p>
            This page documents my original outline, the outline I reviewed, the feedback I provided,
            key feedback I received from peers and tutor, and a reflective summary on how this activity
            improved my understanding of research methods and professional practice.

          <p>
            In my outline, I proposed a study in the area of Artificial Intelligence within Computing.
            The central aim was to examine how AI-based techniques can support decision-making in a
            specific context (for example, fraud detection, intelligent agents or geospatial analysis).
            I formulated a clear research question that followed the guidance from Unit 2:
            it was specific, feasible and linked directly to a practical problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            I proposed a <strong>[quantitative / qualitative / mixed-method]*</strong> design
            (to be specified based on the final topic), ensuring that the research method matched the
            type of data I intended to collect. For example, a quantitative design would involve
            numerical performance metrics and statistical analysis, whereas a qualitative design
            would employ interviews or thematic analysis to explore experiences or perceptions.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also outlined my planned data sources (e.g. publicly available datasets, survey responses,
            or experimental results) and briefly described how these would be analysed to answer the
            research question in a systematic and ethical way.
          </p>

          <div class="cd-accent-box">
            <strong>Note:</strong> The peer review task required not only describing my own research
            idea but justifying the choice of method using the concepts of exploratory vs conclusive
            design, and qualitative vs quantitative vs mixed methods from Seminar 2.

          <p>
            The outline I reviewed focused on a computing topic chosen by my peer, such as cybersecurity,
            AI in healthcare, or data science in education. The peer described their research problem,
            formulated one or more research questions, and identified a preferred research method,
            for example a survey-based quantitative study or a qualitative case study.
          </p>
          <p>
            They also indicated the type of data they intended to collect (e.g. log data, questionnaire
            responses, interview transcripts) and how they planned to analyse that data. My role was to
            evaluate whether these choices were consistent with the research question and whether the
            methods were feasible and ethical.
          </p>

          <div class="cd-accent-box">
            <strong>Key point:</strong> The focus of the peer review was not to “fix” the topic,
            but to check the logic that connects the research question, the method, and the data
            collection and analysis strategy.

            </div>
          </div>

          <p>
            In my feedback, I began by acknowledging the strengths of my peer’s outline—for example,
            a clearly stated topic, a relevant problem in computing, or a strong motivation for the study.
            I then evaluated the research question using the criteria from Unit 2: specificity, relevance,
            feasibility and ethical considerations.
          </p>
          <p>
            I commented on whether the chosen method matched the research aim. For instance, if the peer
            wanted to understand “how” or “why” users behave in a certain way, I suggested that a
            qualitative method (e.g. interviews or case studies) might be more appropriate than a purely
            quantitative questionnaire. Conversely, if the goal was to measure “how many” or “how much”,
            I supported the use of a quantitative survey or experiment.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also asked clarifying questions about data collection and analysis, encouraging the peer
            to think about sampling, validity, and how they would interpret their results. Where relevant,
            I reminded them of the importance of ethical approval and informed consent when collecting
            primary data from human participants.
          </p>

          <div class="cd-accent-box">
            <strong>Overall aim:</strong> My feedback was constructive, focused on improving the match
            between research questions, methods and data, and grounded in the terminology and examples
            discussed in Units 1–3.

              From peer and tutor

          </div>

          <p>
            My peer and tutor provided several useful suggestions on my own outline. They highlighted
            areas where my research question could be made more precise—for example, by narrowing the
            context, clarifying the target population, or focusing on a specific type of AI technique
            rather than a very broad category.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was also encouraged to explain more clearly why I had chosen a particular research method
            and how it related to my aims. For example, if I proposed a mixed-methods design, the feedback
            reminded me to justify why I needed both qualitative and quantitative data instead of just
            one type.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another important point concerned feasibility and ethics: I was asked to consider whether my
            planned data collection would be realistic within the module timeframe and how I would handle
            issues such as consent, privacy and data security. This helped me to revise my outline into a
            more focused and achievable plan.
          </p>

          <div class="cd-accent-box">
            <strong>Impact:</strong> The feedback guided me to tighten my research question, better
            justify my chosen method, and think more carefully about feasibility and ethics.

          <p>
            The Seminar 2 peer review activity helped me move from a theoretical understanding of
            research methods to a more practical and critical perspective. By reviewing another
            student’s outline, I had to actively apply concepts such as research design, qualitative
            and quantitative methods, and the link between questions, data and analysis. This made
            the distinctions between exploratory and conclusive research, and between different method
            types, feel much more concrete.

          <p>
            At the same time, receiving feedback on my own outline showed me that having a good idea
            is not enough; I must be able to justify why a specific method is the best way to answer
            my research question. The comments about narrowing my focus and explaining my method
            choice more clearly have already influenced how I think about future assignments.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, the activity strengthened my ability to read research plans critically, to give
            constructive and respectful feedback, and to integrate feedback into my own work. It also
            highlighted the importance of ethical and practical considerations in research planning.
            This experience will be valuable when designing more advanced projects later in the MSc
            programme.
