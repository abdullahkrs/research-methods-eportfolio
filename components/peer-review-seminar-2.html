    <p class="page-subtitle">
      This page presents my preparation for Seminar 2, where I analysed two AI-related Computing papers
      that use different research methods.
    </p>
    <p class="page-meta">
      The analysis is organised into separate tables following the seminar questions on purpose, methodology,
      data collection and analysis, evidence, and possible enhancements.

    <h2>1. Purpose, Problem, Objective &amp; Alignment with My Experience</h2>
    <p class="section-intro">
      This table summarises the purpose and objectives of each paper and explains how they align with my own
      experience and interests in AI and Computing.

            A Bibliometric Mapping of Themes, Trends, and Global Contributions
          </td>
          <td>
            The paper aims to map research on Artificial Intelligence in management between 2021 and 2025. It identifies
            themes, trends, leading countries, authors and keyword clusters by using bibliometric indicators.
            The focus is on understanding how AI in management has evolved and which topics dominate the field.
          </td>
          <td>
            This aligns with my experience because I work with AI in real organisations and public-sector projects.
            Knowing global research trends in AI management helps me understand where research and practice are heading,
            and how my own work in AI-based systems fits into the wider body of knowledge.

            on Social and Economic Progress
          </td>
          <td>
            The purpose of this paper is to examine how AI and machine learning influence economic development and
            social structures. It looks at opportunities and risks, and studies the relationship between AI readiness
            levels and economic indicators such as GDP through empirical analysis.
          </td>
          <td>
            This connects strongly with my interests, as I am involved in AI projects that affect public services,
            policy and digital transformation. The focus on AI readiness, economic impact and social implications
            matches my thinking about how AI should be adopted responsibly at national and organisational levels.

  <section class="section-block" id="q2">
    <h2>2. Appropriateness of the Research Methodology</h2>
    <p class="section-intro">
      The table below evaluates whether the chosen research methodology in each paper is suitable for the stated
      purpose or research question.
    </p>

    <table class="table-block">
      <caption>Table 2. Research Methodology and Its Appropriateness</caption>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Paper</th>
          <th>Research Method Used</th>
          <th>Is the Methodology Appropriate? (Justification)</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td class="paper-name">Paper 1</td>
          <td>
            The paper uses a <strong>quantitative bibliometric method</strong>. It collects publication data from a
            database (e.g. Scopus), counts documents, citations and keywords, and applies bibliometric tools to
            generate maps of themes, trends and collaborations.
          </td>
          <td>
            Yes, this methodology is appropriate. The research question focuses on “what are the themes and trends”
            in the literature, which is essentially a descriptive and quantitative question. Bibliometric analysis is
            the standard way to measure research output and thematic patterns, so it matches the purpose well.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="paper-name">Paper 2</td>
          <td>
            The paper uses a <strong>mixed-method approach</strong>. It combines a qualitative literature review
            (to identify theoretical perspectives, opportunities and challenges) with quantitative statistical
            analysis (e.g. correlation between AI readiness scores and GDP).
          </td>
          <td>
            Yes, this methodology is appropriate. The topic concerns both conceptual issues (social and economic
            implications) and measurable relationships (AI readiness and economic performance). Mixed methods provide
            a broader and deeper view than a single method and align with the paper’s aim of capturing both theory
            and empirical evidence.

      This table reviews the types of data used in each paper and the analysis techniques, and evaluates whether
      they are suitable for answering the research questions.

            Uses secondary data from a bibliographic database, filtered by year, subject area and other criteria.
            The dataset consists of AI-related management publications from 2021–2025.
          </td>
          <td>
            Applies bibliometric analysis and visualisation tools (e.g. counting publications per year, analysing
            citations, mapping co-occurring keywords and co-authorship networks).
          </td>
          <td>
            This is appropriate because the aim is to describe patterns in the existing literature, not to collect
            new primary data. The combination of database filtering and bibliometric statistics is well suited to
            mapping research themes and trends at scale.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="paper-name">Paper 2</td>
          <td>
            Uses secondary data such as AI readiness indices and economic indicators like GDP, along with published
            research and policy documents to provide context.
          </td>
          <td>
            Employs statistical analysis (for example, Pearson correlation) to explore the relationship between AI
            readiness and economic performance, supported by qualitative interpretation from the literature review.
          </td>
          <td>
            This combination is suitable for the research aims. Correlation analysis is appropriate for studying
            how two measurable variables are related, while the literature review helps interpret the results and
            situate them in a broader social and economic context. It also respects the limits of correlation
            (showing association, not causation).

            backed by quantitative evidence.

          <td>
            The paper presents numeric results (counts, citation metrics), charts showing trends over time, and
            visual maps of keywords and networks. The discussion links these findings back to the research questions
            and explains what the patterns suggest about AI in management.

        <tr>
          <td class="paper-name">Paper 2</td>

            Yes. The conclusions about the impact of AI and ML on social and economic progress are supported by a
            mix of empirical results and theoretical discussion.
          </td>
          <td>
            The paper uses correlation tables to show relationships between AI readiness and GDP, and combines these
            with literature-based arguments about opportunities (e.g. productivity) and risks (e.g. inequality,
            job displacement). This gives the reader both numerical and conceptual support for the claims.
