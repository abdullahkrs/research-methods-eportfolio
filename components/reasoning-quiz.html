          This formative activity focuses on distinguishing between
          <strong>deductive</strong> and <strong>inductive</strong> reasoning.
          Below, I present each question, the correct classification, my answer,
          and a brief explanation of the reasoning involved.

          </p>
          <p>
            This is a classical logical rule. The conclusion follows necessarily
            from the premises with no uncertainty, so it is a clear example of
            <strong>deductive reasoning</strong>.

          <p>
            <strong>Statement:</strong> Since all squares are rectangles, and all
            rectangles have four sides, all squares have four sides.
          </p>
          <p class="meta">
            <strong>My answer:</strong> Deduction (correct)
          </p>
          <p>
            The argument applies general definitions (square → rectangle,
            rectangle → four sides) to derive a necessary conclusion about
            squares. Because the conclusion must be true if the premises are true,
            this is <strong>deductive reasoning</strong>.

          <p>
            <strong>Statement:</strong> All cats have a keen sense of smell.
            Fluffy is a cat, so Fluffy has a keen sense of smell.
          </p>
          <p class="meta">
            <strong>My answer:</strong> Deduction (correct)
          </p>
          <p>
            A general rule about all cats is applied to one specific cat
            (Fluffy). Given the premise, the conclusion follows with certainty,
            so this is a <strong>deductive</strong> argument.

          </h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Statement:</strong> Every time you eat peanuts, your throat
            swells and you can’t breathe. This is a symptom of people who are
            allergic to peanuts. Therefore, you are allergic to peanuts.
          </p>
          <p class="meta">
            <strong>My original answer:</strong> Deduction (incorrect)
            <br />
            <strong>Correct classification:</strong> Induction
          </p>
          <p>
            The conclusion is based on repeated observations of a pattern
            (whenever peanuts are eaten, swelling occurs) and on a medical
            symptom. It generalises from experience to a probable conclusion,
            rather than applying a strict universal rule. For this reason,
            the argument is <strong>inductive</strong> rather than deductive.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>What I learned:</strong> even when the evidence is strong,
            reasoning is still inductive if it relies on patterns and
            observations rather than on formal logical rules.

          <p>
            <strong>Statement:</strong> Tony is a football player. All football
            players weigh more than 170 pounds. Therefore, Tony weighs more
            than 170 pounds.
          </p>
          <p class="meta">
            <strong>My answer:</strong> Deduction (correct)
          </p>
          <p>
            A general statement about all football players is applied directly to
            Tony. If the premise is accepted, the conclusion must be true, so this
            is an example of <strong>deductive reasoning</strong>.

        <!-- Question 6 -->

            Question 6
            <span class="label">Correct</span>
          </h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Statement:</strong> All cars in this town drive on the right
            side of the street. Therefore, all cars in all towns drive on the
            right side of the street.
          </p>
          <p class="meta">
            <strong>My answer:</strong> Induction (correct)
          </p>
          <p>
            The argument overgeneralises from a local observation (one town) to a
            universal claim (all towns). It extends limited evidence to a broad
            conclusion, which is typical of <strong>inductive reasoning</strong>.

        <p>A brief reflection on what I learned from this activity.</p>
      </div>
      <p>
        This formative quiz helped me sharpen the distinction between
        <strong>deductive</strong> and <strong>inductive</strong> reasoning.
        Deductive arguments produce conclusions that follow necessarily
        from their premises, while inductive arguments move from patterns
        and observations to probable conclusions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Question 4 was especially valuable as a learning point. Although the
        evidence was strong, the reasoning was still inductive because it
        relied on repeated experience rather than a formal rule that applies
        to everyone. This insight will support my future work in knowledge
        representation and logical argumentation, where correctly classifying
        the type of reasoning is essential.
