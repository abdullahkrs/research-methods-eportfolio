      <h3>Activity Description</h3>
      <p>
        This discussion ran across Units 1–3 and asked us to analyse a professional ethics case study
        using the ACM and BCS Codes of Ethics and relevant legislation. The focus was on how legal,
        social, cultural and ethical issues affect computing professionals, with an emphasis on
        accessibility, discrimination and professional responsibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        The initial post (minimum 200 words) introduced my analysis of the case; I then responded to
        peers’ posts and finally wrote a summary post reflecting on how the discussion had shaped my
        understanding of ethical and professional practice.

        <h4>Initial Post – Accessibility in Software Development</h4>
        <p>
          In my initial post I discussed the ACM case study <em>Accessibility in Software Development</em>,
          which describes how a project management tool introduced an inline editing feature that
          effectively locked out blind users and those with limited hand movement. I argued that by
          prioritising deadlines over accessibility, the team breached core ACM principles to advance
          human welfare (1.1) and avoid harm (1.2), and failed to meet their duty under the BCS Code
          of Conduct to promote equal access and avoid discrimination.
        </p>
        <p>
          I linked these professional codes to legal frameworks such as the UK Equality Act 2010 and
          the US Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), highlighting that inaccessible digital systems
          can amount to unlawful discrimination. I also drew on academic work which describes
          accessibility as “a core marker of professional quality” and emphasised that inclusive design
          should be built into projects from the very beginning rather than treated as a late
          compliance check.
        </p>

            <p>
              The ACM case study <em>Accessibility in Software Development</em> shows ethical problems that
              appear when software teams ignore accessibility. A project management tool added an inline
              editing feature that locked out users who were blind or had limited hand movement. The ACM
              Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct states that computing professionals must help
              society and human welfare (Principle 1.1) and must not cause harm (Principle 1.2). Because
              the team placed deadlines above accessibility, they violated those duties – users were
              excluded and the organisation’s reputation was damaged.
            </p>
            <p>
              The BCS Code of Conduct requires members to support equal access to technology and avoid
              discrimination against people with disabilities. Under UK and US law, failure to provide
              accessibility can breach the Equality Act 2010 or the Americans with Disabilities Act
              (ADA). Socially, ignoring accessibility pushes people with disabilities to the margins and
              conflicts with the ethical goal of fair, inclusive technology.
            </p>
            <p>
              I concluded that accessibility is not an optional enhancement but a professional
              obligation. Including inclusive design from day one signals professionalism and integrity
              and helps ensure that technology serves every user.

        <h4>Peer Responses – Engaging with Different Case Studies</h4>
        <p>
          I wrote three peer responses, each engaging with a different ethics case study chosen by my
          colleagues. Together these responses helped me connect accessibility with broader issues of
          professional responsibility in computing.

            <p>
              Nelson’s post also analysed the AllTogether accessibility case. In my response I
              reinforced the idea that accessibility is both a moral responsibility and a strategic
              necessity. Drawing on Mäkipää and Naarmala, I argued that integrating accessibility from
              the design phase shows “proactive ethics” and supports universal usability. I agreed that
              neglecting accessibility damages organisational reputation as well as user trust.

            <h5>Response to Jaco – Medical Implant Risk Analysis</h5>
            <p>
              Jaco discussed a medical implant device case. I supported his critique of “negligible
              harm” assumptions and linked them to literature showing how small software oversights can
              escalate into life-threatening failures. I expanded on the need for transparency and
              explainability in digital health systems, noting that hidden hard-coded logic undermines
              patient autonomy and trust. I also highlighted that cost savings must never override
              rigorous risk analysis in high-stakes technologies.

              Nikolaos explored the Blocker Plus content-filtering system. My response focused on the
              risks of biased training data and the importance of fairness, accountability and
              transparency in machine-learning systems. I connected his analysis to current AI
              governance debates and the EU AI Act’s requirements for documentation, monitoring and
              human oversight, arguing that ethical responsibility must be backed by enforceable
              regulation.

            <h5>Response to Nelson</h5>
            <p>
              Nelson, your analysis effectively captures how ethical, legal, and social dimensions
              converge in the AllTogether case. I emphasised that accessibility is both a moral
              responsibility and a technical necessity, building on the ACM and BCS codes and academic
              work on universal usability and proactive ethics. I also discussed reputational harm and
              the importance of accessible design for user trust.
            </p>

            <h5>Response to Jaco</h5>
            <p>
              Jaco, you provided a strong evaluation of ethical risks in the medical implant case. My
              response underlined that even small programming oversights can be life-threatening and
              that this violates the BCS requirement to prioritise public health and safety. I also
              drew on literature about transparency and values in digital medical technologies to show
              why rigorous risk analysis and explainable design are essential.
            </p>

            <h5>Response to Nikolaos</h5>
            <p>
              Nikolaos, your critique of Blocker Plus highlighted discriminatory outcomes caused by
              biased feedback loops. I linked this to research on disparate impact in big data and
              stressed the need for explainability so that affected groups can challenge harmful
              outputs. I also related the case to evolving AI regulation, including the EU AI Act, to
              show how professional ethics and legal accountability are converging.

      <!-- Summary Post -->
      <article class="card">
        <h4>Summary Post – What I Learned from the Discussion</h4>
        <p>
          In my summary post I reflected that accessibility failures are not just technical bugs but
          ethical and professional failures. Re-reading my own post and peers’ feedback helped me see
          that harm arises when teams treat accessibility as optional rather than as a core duty. The
          discussion introduced me to the idea of “systemic exclusion” – how normal development
          routines can unintentionally shut people out when accessibility has low priority.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also concluded that accessibility work signals professional quality. Research we discussed
          argues that accessibility should start early and continue throughout the project, and that
          universal usability benefits all users, not only those with disabilities. For me, the key
          takeaway was that responsible engineering means weaving accessibility into the project from
          day one and building a culture where anyone can raise an accessibility concern without
          hesitation.
        </p>

          <div class="details-body">
            <p>
              The discussion on the Accessibility in Software Development case has shown that
              accessibility failures are not only technical errors but also ethical and professional
              failures. When AllTogether released an inaccessible feature, the team broke ACM and BCS
              principles regarding human welfare, harm and equal access. Peer feedback emphasised that
              harm occurred because accessibility was treated as optional and that this created
              systemic exclusion.
            </p>
            <p>
              Peers also highlighted that accessibility is a marker of professional quality and should
              be integrated from the start of a project. Drawing on Mäkipää and Naarmala and
              Shneiderman’s work on universal usability, I concluded that accessibility is a legal
              requirement, a professional obligation and a foundation for an inclusive digital culture.

      <h3>Personal Reflection</h3>
      <p>
        This component helped me move from viewing accessibility as a checklist item to recognising it
        as a central part of professional identity in computing. Comparing different case studies
        (accessibility, medical devices and content filtering) showed that the same ethical themes
        recur: responsibility to avoid harm, the need for inclusive design, and the importance of
        transparency and accountability.
      </p>
      <p>
        Engaging with my peers’ posts also developed my academic communication skills. I had to use
        evidence from professional codes and scholarly sources while responding respectfully and
        constructively. This experience will directly influence my research project, where I intend to
        design and evaluate solutions with accessibility and ethical impact embedded from the outset.
